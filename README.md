# D3-challenge

For this challenge I was successfully able to read in the csv file and create the scatter plot using D3 techniques that I've learned.  I was also able to create a dynamic graph that transitions whenever a new selection is made.  The data I chose to represent was Median Household Income, Obesity rates, and Healthcare.  Some key techniques used in my code were event listeners, tool tips to highlight information for specific states, the use of several functions that are called when the user selects a new dataset, and adding text to svg graphics.
